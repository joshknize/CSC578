    "# 1. Introduction to libraries\n",
    "### We have used the following libraries in this project:\n",
    "* **`Detectron 2`: Is developed and maintained by FaceBook Research**\n",
    "    * The reason this was chosen because of the modularity it provides and the plethora of model configurations it gives access to\n",
    "    * Each model option is deeply cunfigurable down to the different architectural blocks\n",
    "    * It also has support for loading in custom backbone without minimum codebased change in that of `detectron2` itself\n",
    "    * All these benefits made it an ideal choice for us, as it made integration of our custom `HebbNet` bacbone much easier\n",
    "* **`Matplotlib`: Is a real standard library used for showcasing output images**\n",
    "* **`torch`: is the work engine of `detectron2` and most of Deep Learning libraries**|\n",
    "* **`numpy`: Is used again as another work engine of torch itself, but also is used for performing various linear algebric functions throughout the project**\n",
